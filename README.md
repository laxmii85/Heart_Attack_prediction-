Heart Disease Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing on a heart disease dataset to prepare it for predictive modeling. The dataset contains various patient attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, and heart rate, which are analyzed to understand patterns and relationships with heart disease outcomes.

The goal is to explore the dataset, clean and preprocess the data, and prepare it for machine learning tasks, such as predicting the likelihood of heart disease.

Dataset
The dataset (heart.csv) contains 918 patient records with 12 features:

Age: Patient's age
Sex: Gender (M/F)
ChestPainType: Type of chest pain (ATA, NAP, ASY, TA)
RestingBP: Resting blood pressure
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol level
FastingBS: Fasting blood sugar (1 = >120 mg/dl, 0 = otherwise)
RestingECG: Resting electrocardiogram results (Normal, ST, LVH)
MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved
ExerciseAngina: Exercise-induced angina (Y/N)
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise
ST_Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Up, Flat, Down)
HeartDisease: Target variable (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease
